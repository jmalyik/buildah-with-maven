# Dead Simple Maven + Buildah Image to Simplify GitLab Builds

Out of the box (OOTB), you usually need two jobs in your CI pipeline to produce a Java artifact and package it into a Docker image: a Maven build job and a separate Docker build job.

This image combines both steps so you can run Maven builds inside the image itself and build your artifact in one step.

## Why Use This Image?

- Usually, you either have to push images to a local registry within your CI/CD environment, which can be complicated, or  
- You have to pre-configure registry credentials on your runners or environment, which is not always feasible.

This image simplifies that process by packaging Maven, OpenJDK, and Buildah in one.

## User Guide: Branch Naming Convention for Image Builds

This repository supports building images with different versions of Java and Maven. To select the versions, use branch names formatted as follows:



```
jdk<JavaVersion>-maven<MavenVersion>
```


### Examples

| Branch Name        | Java Version | Maven Version |
|--------------------|--------------|---------------|
| `jdk11-maven3.6.3` | 11           | 3.6.3         |
| `jdk17-maven3.8.6` | 17           | 3.8.6         |
| `jdk21-maven3.9.0` | 21           | 3.9.0         |

- When pushing to a branch like `jdk11-maven3.6.3`, the GitHub Action will build an image using OpenJDK 11 and Maven 3.6.3.
- Branches that donâ€™t follow this naming pattern will cause the workflow to fail, to prevent ambiguous builds.
- The `main` branch does **not** trigger image builds to avoid accidental builds on production code.

---

## How to Use

1. Create or checkout a branch with the naming convention, e.g., `jdk11-maven3.6.3`.
2. Push your code to GitHub.
3. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and push a Docker image tagged with the corresponding Java and Maven versions.
4. Use this image directly in your GitLab CI or any other pipeline, no need for a separate Maven build step.

---

## Docker Hub Credentials

Make sure to add your Docker Hub username and access token as GitHub repository secrets:

- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`  
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`

These are used by the workflow to authenticate and push the image.

If you want to support additional Java or Maven versions, simply add the corresponding tags in your branch names and update the workflow if needed.
